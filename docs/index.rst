Welcome to mtflib's documentation!
==================================

`mtflib` is a Python library for creating, manipulating, and composing
Multivariate Taylor Functions, with a C++ backend for performance-critical
applications. It provides a robust framework for working with multivariate
Taylor series expansions based on the principles of Differential Algebra (DA).

This library is designed for scientists, engineers, and researchers who need
to perform high-order differentiation, integration, and function composition
in a computationally efficient manner.
