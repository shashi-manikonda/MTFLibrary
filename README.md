[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)  **A Python library for creating, manipulating, and composing Multivariate Taylor Functions.**

## Overview

MTFLibrary is a Python library designed to facilitate the use of Multivariate Taylor Functions (MTFs) in symbolic and numerical computations. It provides classes and methods for:

*   Representing multivariate Taylor functions up to a specified order.
*   Performing basic arithmetic operations on MTFs (addition, subtraction, multiplication, scalar operations).
*   Calculating partial derivatives of MTFs.
*   Composing MTFs through variable substitution, implementing the chain rule.
*   Evaluating MTFs at specific points.
*   Truncating MTFs to a desired order.
*   Elementary functions like cosine and sine as MTFs.
*   String representation of MTFs in table format.

This library is useful for applications in areas like:

*   Sensitivity analysis
*   Uncertainty quantification
*   Automatic differentiation
*   Nonlinear system analysis

## Installation

To install MTFLibrary, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install MTFLibrary  # If you plan to package and distribute, otherwise instructions might be different
