"""
Manages precomputed Taylor series coefficients.

This module is responsible for computing, caching, and loading the Taylor
series coefficients for various elementary functions. The coefficients are
computed up to a specified order (`MAX_PRECOMPUTED_ORDER`) and stored in
JSON files within the `precomputed_coefficients_data` directory.

This precomputation avoids expensive recalculations during runtime,
significantly speeding up the creation of Taylor series for elementary
functions. The `load_precomputed_coefficients` function handles the logic
of loading from files or recomputing if necessary.

    Loads or precomputes Taylor coefficients for elementary functions.

    This function checks for cached coefficients in JSON files. If a file
    exists and its order is sufficient, the coefficients are loaded from it.
    Otherwise, they are recomputed, saved to a JSON file, and then loaded.
    The loaded coefficients are stored in the global `precomputed_coefficients`
    dictionary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    max_order_config : int, optional
        The maximum order required for the coefficients. If not provided,
        the module's `MAX_PRECOMPUTED_ORDER` is used.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary where keys are function names (e.g., 'sin') and
        values are NumPy arrays of their Taylor coefficients up to the
        requested order.

    Examples
    --------

    `MultivariateTaylorFunction.initialize_mtf`.
