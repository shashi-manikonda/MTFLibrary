    "*   Explore both serial (`serial_biot_savart`) and MPI-parallel (`mpi_biot_savart`) computation options.\n",
    "*   Validate MTFLibrary results by comparing them to analytical solutions.\n",
    "*   Interpret Taylor series coefficients to understand the behavior of the magnetic field.\n",

    "*   `matplotlib.pyplot` and `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d` are imported for plotting, although this notebook doesn't explicitly contain plotting commands. These are useful for visualizing results in more complex analyses.\n",
    "*   `initialize_mtf_globals(max_order=4, max_dimension=4)`: This line is **critical**. It initializes the global settings for MTFLibrary.  \n",
    "    *   `max_order=4` sets the maximum order of Taylor expansions that will be computed. Higher order means potentially greater accuracy but also increased computational cost.\n",
    "    *   `max_dimension=4` defines the maximum number of independent variables our MTFs can have. For this electromagnetic example, we will use up to 4 variables to represent spatial coordinates and potentially other parameters.\n",
    "*   `set_global_etol(1e-16)`: Sets the global error tolerance. Coefficients in Taylor series with an absolute value smaller than this tolerance will be truncated to zero. This helps to manage the size of MTFs and improve computational efficiency without sacrificing precision for relevant terms."

    "    *   `zc+z`: This sets the z-component. `zc` is a scalar z-coordinate, and `z` is our MTF variable. So, `zc + z` creates an MTF where the constant term is `zc` and the linear term in the z-direction is present (coefficient 1 for the 'z' variable). This allows us to evaluate the magnetic field as a function of position *along* the z-axis, represented by the MTF variable `z`.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "*   `if rank == 0:`:  Ensures that the output and analysis section is executed only by the master process (rank 0) in MPI parallel mode, or by the single process in serial mode. This prevents redundant output from each process in parallel execution.\n",
    "*   `mid_point = num_field_points_axis//2`: Calculates the index of the middle field point in `field_points_axis` array. We will examine the magnetic field at this middle point as a representative example.\n",
    "*   `print(\"Magnetic field along axis of rotated ring (Example 1 - Element Input, first point):\")`\n",
    "    `print(B_field_ring_axis[mid_point][2])`: Prints the z-component (index 2) of the calculated magnetic field (which is an MTF) at the middle field point. This MTF represents the Taylor expansion of the Bz component at that point.\n",
    "*   **Integration and Substitution for 1D Bz field:**\n",
    "    *   `Bzfldxyz = integrate(B_field_ring_axis[mid_point][2],4,-1,1)`: Integrates the z-component of the magnetic field (`B_field_ring_axis[mid_point][2]`) with respect to the 4th dimension (variable `u`) from -1 to 1.  In this example, `u` isn't explicitly varied in the field point definition, so this integration might seem trivial. However, it demonstrates the `integrate` function's usage.  In scenarios where the field points *do* depend on `u`, this integration would compute an average field value over the range of `u`.\n",
    "    *   `Bzfld = Bzfldxyz.substitute_variable(1,0).substitute_variable(2,0)`: Substitutes `x=0` (dimension 1) and `y=0` (dimension 2) into the integrated MTF `Bzfldxyz`. This effectively restricts the MTF to be a function of only the z-coordinate (dimension 3), as we are interested in the Bz field along the z-axis.\n",
    "    *   `print('Bz field along z: \\n', Bzfld)`: Prints the resulting 1D MTF `Bzfld`, which now represents the Bz component of the magnetic field as a function of position along the z-axis.\n",
    "*   **Analytical Comparison:**\n",
    "    *   `analytic_fun_expr = ...`:  Defines the analytical expression for the magnetic field along the axis of a current loop. This formula is derived from classical electromagnetism.  We represent this analytical formula as an MTF using `sqrt_taylor` to handle the square root function within the expression.\n",
    "    *   `print('Analytic_fun expression:\\n',analytic_fun_expr)`: Prints the MTF form of the analytical expression.\n",
    "    *   **Coefficient Comparison Table:** The code then proceeds to compare the coefficients of the Taylor expansion of the Bz field calculated by MTFLibrary (`Bzfld`) with the Taylor expansion coefficients of the analytical solution (`analytic_fun_expr`). It generates a table that shows the exponents, the coefficients from both MTFLibrary and the analytical solution, and the error (difference) between them. This table is crucial for validating the accuracy of the MTFLibrary computation by comparing it against a known analytical result. The small errors shown in the output table demonstrate the high accuracy of MTFLibrary's MTF-based Biot-Savart calculations for this example."

    "## 6. Further Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a basic demonstration of magnetic field calculation using MTFLibrary. You can extend this example and explore more features of the library by:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Varying Ring Parameters:** Experiment with different values for `ring_radius`, `num_segments_ring`, `ring_center_point`, and `ring_axis_direction` to see how these parameters affect the magnetic field.\n",
    "*   **Calculating Fields in 2D or 3D:** Modify `field_points_axis` to define field points on a plane (e.g., the x-y plane) or in a 3D volume to map the magnetic field in space.\n",
    "*   **Increasing Taylor Expansion Order:** Increase `max_order` in `initialize_mtf_globals` to compute higher-order Taylor expansions for potentially increased accuracy (at the cost of computation time).\n",
    "*   **Exploring Other EMLibrary Features:** Investigate other functions in `EMLibrary`, such as those for calculating vector potential or magnetic forces.\n",
    "*   **Visualizing Results:** Use `matplotlib` to plot the magnetic field components as functions of position based on the MTF results. You can evaluate the MTFs at a range of numerical points and then plot these values.\n",
    "*   **Investigating Performance:** If you have `mpi4py` installed, compare the execution time of `serial_biot_savart` and `mpi_biot_savart` for larger problems (e.g., with more ring segments or field points) to observe the benefits of parallelization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to consult the MTFLibrary documentation, the `demo` directory, and the `test` directory for more examples and advanced usage patterns."
