This notebook is designed to be educational and easy to follow for new users, with detailed comments and explanations.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# **Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "# *   Understand how to set up and run `mtflib` simulations, including global settings and variable definition.\n",
    "# *   Learn to utilize the electromagnetism extension to calculate magnetic fields using the Biot-Savart law.\n",
    "# *   Explore both serial (`serial_biot_savart`) and MPI-parallel (`mpi_biot_savart`) computation options.\n",
    "# *   Validate `mtflib` results by comparing them to analytical solutions.\n",
    "# *   Interpret Taylor series coefficients to understand the behavior of the magnetic field.\n",

    "# **Explanation:**\n",
    "# *   We import `numpy` for numerical array handling, which is fundamental for `mtflib`'s efficient operations.\n",
    "# *   `from mtflib import *` imports the core `mtflib` classes and functions. This includes `MultivariateTaylorFunction`, `Var`, and other essential components for working with MTFs.\n",
    "# *   We specifically import `mpi_biot_savart` and `serial_biot_savart` for calculating magnetic fields using the Biot-Savart law, and `current_ring` to define the geometry of our current source.\n",
    "# *   `matplotlib.pyplot` and `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d` are imported for plotting, although this notebook doesn't explicitly contain plotting commands. These are useful for visualizing results in more complex analyses.\n",
    "# *   `initialize_mtf_globals(max_order=4, max_dimension=4)`: This line is **critical**. It initializes the global settings for `mtflib`.  \n",
    "#     *   `max_order=4` sets the maximum order of Taylor expansions that will be computed. Higher order means potentially greater accuracy but also increased computational cost.\n",
    "#     *   `max_dimension=4` defines the maximum number of independent variables our MTFs can have. For this electromagnetic example, we will use up to 4 variables to represent spatial coordinates and potentially other parameters.\n",
    "# *   `set_global_etol(1e-16)`: Sets the global error tolerance. Coefficients in Taylor series with an absolute value smaller than this tolerance will be truncated to zero. This helps to manage the size of MTFs and improve computational efficiency without sacrificing precision for relevant terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## 2. Define MTF Variables\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Next, we define the symbolic variables that will represent the dimensions of our problem space within the Multivariate Taylor Functions. We use `Var(dimension_index)` to create these symbolic variables.  These variables act as the independent variables in our Taylor expansions."

So, `zc + z` creates an MTF where the constant term is `zc` and the linear term in the z-direction is present (coefficient 1 for the 'z' variable). This allows us to evaluate the magnetic field as a function of position *along* the z-axis, represented by the MTF variable `z`.\n",

    "#     *   `print('Bz field along z: \\n', Bzfld)`: Prints the resulting 1D MTF `Bzfld`, which now represents the Bz component of the magnetic field as a function of position along the z-axis.\n",
    "# *   **Analytical Comparison:**\n",
    "#     *   `analytic_fun_expr = ...`:  Defines the analytical expression for the magnetic field along the axis of a current loop. This formula is derived from classical electromagnetism.  We represent this analytical formula as an MTF using `sqrt_taylor` to handle the square root function within the expression.\n",
    "#     *   `print('Analytic_fun expression:\\n',analytic_fun_expr)`: Prints the MTF form of the analytical expression.\n",
    "#     *   **Coefficient Comparison Table:** The code then proceeds to compare the coefficients of the Taylor expansion of the Bz field calculated by `mtflib` (`Bzfld`) with the Taylor expansion coefficients of the analytical solution (`analytic_fun_expr`). It generates a table that shows the exponents, the coefficients from both `mtflib` and the analytical solution, and the error (difference) between them. This table is crucial for validating the accuracy of the `mtflib` computation by comparing it against a known analytical result. The small errors shown in the output table demonstrate the high accuracy of `mtflib`'s MTF-based Biot-Savart calculations for this example.\n",

    "# ## 6. Further Exploration\n",
    "# \n",
    "# This notebook provides a basic demonstration of magnetic field calculation using `mtflib`. You can extend this example and explore more features of the library by:\n",
    "# \n",
    "# *   **Varying Ring Parameters:** Experiment with different values for `ring_radius`, `num_segments_ring`, `ring_center_point`, and `ring_axis_direction` to see how these parameters affect the magnetic field.\n",
    "# *   **Calculating Fields in 2D or 3D:** Modify `field_points_axis` to define field points on a plane (e.g., the x-y plane) or in a 3D volume to map the magnetic field in space.\n",
    "# *   **Increasing Taylor Expansion Order:** Increase `max_order` in `initialize_mtf_globals` to compute higher-order Taylor expansions for potentially increased accuracy (at the cost of computation time).\n",
    "# *   **Exploring Other Electromagnetism Features:** Investigate other functions in the electromagnetism extension, such as those for calculating vector potential or magnetic forces.\n",
    "# *   **Visualizing Results:** Use `matplotlib` to plot the magnetic field components as functions of position based on the MTF results. You can evaluate the MTFs at a range of numerical points and then plot these values.\n",
    "# *   **Investigating Performance:** If you have `mpi4py` installed, compare the execution time of `serial_biot_savart` and `mpi_biot_savart` for larger problems (e.g., with more ring segments or field points) to observe the benefits of parallelization.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Remember to consult the `mtflib` documentation, the `demos` directory, and the `tests` directory for more examples and advanced usage patterns."
