# mtflib Demonstrations

Welcome to the `mtflib` demos! This directory contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts to help you learn and explore the capabilities of the library.

## Demo Structure

The demos are organized into the following categories:

- **`1_beginner/`**: Start here if you are new to `mtflib`. These notebooks cover the basic concepts and functionalities.
- **`2_advanced_topics/`**: Once you are comfortable with the basics, explore these notebooks to learn about more advanced features.
- **`3_performance/`**: This section contains performance benchmarks.

## Recommended Order

We recommend going through the notebooks in the following order:

1.  **`1_beginner/0_Quick_Start.ipynb`**: A quick introduction to get you up and running.
2.  **`1_beginner/1_Basic_Functionality.ipynb`**: A more detailed look at the core features.
3.  **`2_advanced_topics/2_Advanced_Functionality.ipynb`**: Learn about substitution, composition, and more.
4.  **`2_advanced_topics/3_Taylor_Maps.ipynb`**: A guide to using the `TaylorMap` object.
5.  **`2_advanced_topics/4_Convergence_and_Accuracy.ipynb`**: A discussion on the convergence and accuracy of Taylor series.

The script in `3_performance/` can be run at any time to see the performance benefits of `mtflib`.
